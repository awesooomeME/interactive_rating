## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

The project did not require any thing that I did not know already although I am bit conscious on 
my usage of ternary operator to display to the different views. I'm not sure if that's what is done
on the industry or if there's a better and cleaner code.

### Continued development

The project looks great on the specified screen sizes but fall short on any screen size in between.
Also, I think it would be great if the Thank you message would be different depending on the rating
given by the user. For example if a user gives a rating below 3 then obviously the user did not had
a great time using the service, so a link perhaps that would redirect the user to submit a complain
or suggestion.
